# react-test-recipes
A growing set of examples for testing React including different coding styles, techniques, test libraries, and test frameworks

If you'd like to contribute and add test examples, please DM Dave via slack.wedotdd.com or email him directly at wedotdd@gmail.com to request collaborator permissions for pull requests.

We're looking for developers to add example tests based on many combinations of frameworks, code techniques, and libraries.  

For example:

- React Test Utils + mocha + chai
- React Test Utils + mocha + chai + custom mocks, stubs, fakes
- React Test Utils + mocha + chai + sinon
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme + custom mocks, stubs, fakes
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme + sinon
- Jest
- Ava
- tape
- Hamcrest
- Meteor + mocha
- Meteor + Jest
- Meteor + tape
- trails
- ??? - feel free to suggest more libs, frameworks, and combinations thereof
