# react-test-recipes
A growing set of examples for testing React including different coding styles, techniques, test libraries, and test frameworks.

Categories of tests include:

- Vanilla React - custom code
- React + Flux
- React + Redux
- React + Meteor
- React + Sails
- React + Trails
- ... and whatever else in the future

If you'd like to contribute and add test examples, please DM Dave via [slack.wedotdd.com](slack.wedotdd.com) or email him directly at wedotdd@gmail.com to request collaborator permissions for pull requests.

We're looking for developers to add example tests based on many combinations of frameworks, code techniques, and libraries and based on different use cases and context around testing with React.  

For example:

- React Test Utils + mocha + chai
- React Test Utils + mocha + chai + custom mocks, stubs, fakes
- React Test Utils + mocha + chai + sinon
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme + custom mocks, stubs, fakes
- Enzyme + mocha + chai-enzyme + sinon
- Jest
- Ava
- tape
- Hamcrest
- Meteor + mocha
- Meteor + Jest
- Meteor + tape
- trails
- ??? - feel free to suggest more libs, frameworks, and combinations thereof
